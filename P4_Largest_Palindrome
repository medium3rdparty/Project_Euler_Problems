% A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
% The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
% 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

% Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


% Thought process two 3-digits numbers can make a largest number
% 999 x 999 = 998001
% the largest palindrome will be the palindrome closest to 998001
